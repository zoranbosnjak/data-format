Hi Zoran.

I've added a file to your gist.

It's compilable code, and:

- explores mostly the static interface,
- allows the dynamic interface as a special case of the static one
  (using existential, see the "lift" functions),
- demonstrates use of accessors.

I'm not claiming this is the only or even the right way to do things,
but perhaps based on this, you can let me know what of the things you
want to do you can now do, and what other things you still do not
know how to do.

The parsing uses Megaparsec. That's not the only choice, but a sensible
one. I don't think my code has any other non-trivial package
dependencies, but if you have trouble building it, I can provide a
full package.

Best,
Andres
